# Creative 404 Page Illustrations

Welcome to the Creative 404 Page Illustrations project! ðŸŽ¨

We believe that even when users stumble upon a missing page, they should have a bit of fun. That's why we've created unique and humorous illustrations for our 404 error pages. This project welcomes contributors who are passionate about adding creativity to error pages.
