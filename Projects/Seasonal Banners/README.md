# Seasonal Banners Showcase

Welcome to the Seasonal Banners Showcase project! This project displays a collection of seasonal banners for different seasons, including summer, winter, and holidays.

## Features

- Interactive Banners: Click on a banner to view additional information or navigate to a related page.
- Hover Animation: Banners have a subtle scale-up effect when you hover over them.


## How It Works

The loading animation appears when users access your website. It keeps users entertained and provides a smooth transition to your website's content.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open `index.html` in your browser to see the loading animation in action.

## Customization

You can easily customize the loading animation by modifying the CSS and JavaScript files. Feel free to add more animations, change colors, or adjust the timing to suit your website's style.
